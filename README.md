# Challenge 01 code refractor

## Description
This challenge simulated an on-the-job ticket request to refractor code to improve accessibility. Accessibility is a very important requirement in society both morally and codified within law in many nations. Outdated software and websites is disadvantageously holding back people with disabilities from accessing information.

By using semantic elements screen readers used by visionally impaired individuals understand the code more easily. Furthermore semantic code improves readability of code to developers and helps create structured code.
